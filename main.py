"""
The program generates a square of random color in a window. After a while, the square's color will change to a different
random color by changing the color's red, green, and blue values (from the RGB spectrum).

A label beneath the square will display the color name based on the current color's hue value (from the HSV spectrum).

The color will continue to change until the window is closed.
